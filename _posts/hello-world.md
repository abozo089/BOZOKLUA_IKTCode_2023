title: 'MINORITIES and the major systems of oppression'
excerpt: The pressure that the strong creates on the weak is a term that is open to adaptation in all kinds of concepts. But if there is a system that portrays the minority as "weak", who are its creators? And what do they want from us? Let's see...

When you look at the picture above, what kind of associations does it bring to you about our title, today? When choosing this picture, what I had in mind was the oppression systems that restrict a large group of people called minority in their own web. So it's actually a trap that shows this group of people as small and powerless in a hierarchy structure. 

Well, aside from the connotations, who are these oppression systems? They are power dynamics that can change according to the subject you are studying and are assumed to be more "superior" in the hierarchical structure in terms of social and cultural acceptability. This can be a domination over masculine structure on the feminine, heterosexuality over homosexuality, or monogamous relationships over non-monogamous ones. 

So what do they do to deserve the word oppression? I would like to answer this with the system of opression that heteronormativity builds on homosexuality to a large extent. The results of the researches and readings I did on this subject show that queer people are more exposed to depression, anxiety, and psychological and/or physical violence that will endanger their sexual well-being than heterosexual people. Here, the difference at this point shows you what the systems of oppression do and what results it produce. Pressure starts with discriminatory attitude. It starts with describing the majority as normal. That's why I don't like the word normal at all. I always avoid using it in my daily life. You might ask why. Because normal makes something outside of itself abnormal. It questions the abnormal. Then, I call out to the oppression system that describes heterosexuality as normal, the nature of human beings, if it is the physical, psychological or sexual violence that the abnormals are exposed separates the normal and the abnormal according to you, would you like to call yourself normal?
