Dear readers, 

Today this article will be the first of a new blog series with you. It's called My Sexual Dictionary. I invite you to an adventure where we will zoom in on the subject in order to look at the issues we discussed from a wider perspective. 
Today's concepts and words: Queer people, cis-gender, homonormativity, consensual non-monogamy, sexual orientation and gender.

Queer People: This is an umbrella term. Queer broadly encompasses anyone who does not consider himself heterosexual or cisgender.

Cis-gender: It is used for people who match the gender and sex assigned to them at birth. For example, we can use the term cis-gender for someone who was born with a male genitalia and describes himself as male, or for someone who was born with a female genitalia and describes herself as a woman. Trans gender is used for the opposite of this situation. If a person born with a female genitalia does not describe their gender expression as a woman, we can call this person a transgender. 

Homonormativity: This pattern is based on a very interesting point of view. To understand well, I would first like to briefly explain to you what heteronormativity means. Heteronormativity is a state of superiority, privilage and favouritism, by accepting heterosexuality as it should be. Homonormativity is the reflection of the same logic system among LQBTQ+ individuals. According to this view, a cis-gendered and monogamous homosexual is socially more privilage, and preferred among LGBTQ+. 

Consensual non-monogamy: Mono means one in Latin, -gamy means marriage. Monogamous relationship is used when a person has only one partner. Non-monogamy is used for people with more than one partner. The consensual adjective we used at the beginning is of great importance because it justifies the situation. This means that the individual has made it clear that they have more than one partner.

Sexual orientation and gender: I wanted to talk about these two concepts together because I think they are confused or misused. I hope I'm wrong! Sexual orientation is determined according to the sex and gender of the person to whom the person is sexually attracted. If a person is interested in someone of the same sex or gender, they are considered homosexuals, if they are interested in someone of the same sex or gender, they are heterosexual, or if they are interested in people of both sexes or genders, they are considered bisexual. It is also in the case that they are not interested in any sex or gender and is called asexual. Gender, on the other hand, is related to how a person feels when they consider psychological, social and cultural aspects. And of course, this is not limited to men or women. A person can put their gender identity into many umbrella terms such as transgender, queergender, non-binary, genderfluid, two-spirit. In the second blog of My Sexual Dictionary, we can take a closer look at a few terms that I have listed here. What do you think?
